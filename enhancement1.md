# Narrative
<p>For the first enhancement artifact, I chose a program from when I took IT-145 Foundation in Application Development where we created a pet boarding program, in Java, that tracked the number of pet spaces available, how many days the pet would stay, and if the pet owner wanted their pets groomed. We created pseudocode for a pricing calculator but never created the code for it, as that was not the point of the assignment. The reason I have included this artifact is that I wanted to have a baseline starter for my capstone project so that I could have a more solid plan for demonstrating my skills rather than jumping around to different projects from the past. For enhancement one specifically, I decided to convert the original Java program to the Python language so that I could demonstrate that I understand programming logic enough to translate from one language to another.</p> 

<p>The course outcomes I planned to meet with this enhancement were to show that I have the skills to translate a program from Java to Python to achieve the same functionality. However, I went slightly beyond that and included some other minor enhancements to improve the functionality, such as handling cat and dog check-ins separately, handling new and returning cats and dogs separately, and moving the grooming function (to be fully implemented later) to its own function as well.</p> 

<p>These enhancements create a cleaner program overall because it has specific functions instead of everything being contained within one function like in the Java program. I have also included much-needed improvements in the use of comments to explain what each function is supposed to do and used in-line comments as further explanations for what a line does within a function. I didnâ€™t have many issues come up while converting the code because the program itself was simple to begin with, however, I do anticipate issues to crop up when performing my other planned enhancements to this program.</p>
