# Professional Self-Assessment
<p>Throughout my computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have developed a comprehensive set of technical and professional skills that have prepared me for a carrer in software development. In my capstone course, I was tasked with achieving five course outcomes that demonstrate my abilities as a software engineer. Those course outcomes are team collaboration and communication, data structures and algorithms, software engineering, database design and implementation, and developing a security mindset.</p>

<ins>Team Collaboration and Communication</ins>

<p>My coursework has emphasized the importance of effective collaboration in software development. Through various projects, I was able to learn the ins and outs of working within a development environment and collaborating with team members using agile methodology. The evolution of my pet boarding system demonstrates my ability to document and communicate technical concepts clearly through an initial code review, detailed comments within the code, and explaining each artifact thoroughly through narratives for each enhancement I completed.</p>

<ins>Data Structures and Algorithms</ins>

<p>My understanding of data structures and algorithms has grown significantly throughout the program. I have learned to evaluate and implement optimal solutions for complex problems. In my second enhancement for the pet boarding system, I demonstrated this by implementing dictionaries for efficient space and price management, replacing hard-coded values with flexible data structures that improved both performance and maintainability. I also created other methods such as a check-out method, pricing calculations, and provided a detailed receipt output to document transactions with the pet boarding system. My third enhancement took the data structures and algorithms a step further by incorporating a database system.</p>

<ins>Software Engineering</ins>

<p>Throughout my time at SNHU I have learned the importance of systematic software development approaches through many different assignments and projects. I have learned to apply software engineering principles from requirements gathering to implementation and testing. My transformation of the pet boarding system from Java to Python, and subsequent enhancements, showcases my ability to refactor code, implement new features, and maintain clean, modular codebases.</p>

<ins>Database Design and Implementation</ins>

<p>Through courses in database design and management, I have developed strong skills in data modeling and database implementation. The third enhancement of my pet boarding system demonstrates this through the integration of MongoDB, implementing proper indexing, managing data relationships, and ensuring data persistence â€“ all are critical skills for modern application development.</p>

<ins>Security Mindset</ins>

<p>Security has been a top priority and a fundamental consideration throughout my education. I have learned to anticipate potential vulnerabilities and implement appropriate safeguards. My security mindset has been demonstrated throughout each enhancement with data and input validation. However, my security mindset is highlighted in my database enhancement where I demonstrate data and input validation but also implement owner verification, email validation, and secure data handling practices.</p>

<ins>Portfolio Overview</ins>

My ePortfolio showcases three major enhancements to a pet boarding system which demonstrates my growth and capabilities across different areas of software development:
1.	Language translation and Software engineering: The first enhancement demonstrates my ability to translate and interpret different programming languages while improving code structure and providing proper documentation through comments and functionality explanations.
2.	Data Structures and Algorithms: The second enhancement shows my skills in implementing efficient data structures and algorithms, improving both functionality and maintainability by building upon the first enhancement.
3.	Database Integration and Security: The third enhancement demonstrates my database design and implementation skills, along with security considerations in a full-stack application and development environment. Exhibiting a well-rounded understanding of application development.

<p>Together, these artifacts represent my journey from basic programming concepts to developing secure, efficient, and maintainable software solutions. They demonstrate my technical proficiency and my understanding of software development via best practices and professional coding standards. The progression of these enhancements reflects my ability to iterate and improve upon existing solutions, exhibiting a crucial skill in software development. Each enhancement builds upon the previous one and shows the software development process with increased complexity and sophistication in both design and implementation.</p>

<p>This ePortfolio aims to demonstrate my readiness for professional software development roles by showcasing both technical and professional competencies. Each artifact represents my ability to develop solutions that are not only technically sound but also maintainable, secure, and aligned with business needs.</p>
